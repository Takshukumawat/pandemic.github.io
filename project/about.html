<h1><center>AWARENESS TOWARD COWS</center></h1>
<h2>WHAT IS LUMPY SKIN DISEASE</h2>
<p>Cattle are susceptible to Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD), which is brought on by the Poxviridae family member Capripoxvirus. The Neethling Virus is another name for this disease.

When Lumpy Skin Disease was discovered for the first time in 1929, it was only seen in southern Africa and Madagascar. Since then, it has expanded to the Middle East, southern Europe, and Southeast Asia.

</P>

<h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
<P>The symptoms of Lumpy Skin Disease are as follows:

1.41°C high fever<br>
2.Enlarged lymph nodes<br>
3.The development of many nodules on the skin ( up to 5 cm in diameter)<br>
4.Discharge from the nose and eyes<br>
5.Lameness or a loss of mobility<br>
</P>

<h2> INCUBATION PERIOD</h2>
Four to fourteen days after the infection, Lumpy Skin Disease starts to manifest. High temperature is the first sign, which is followed by limb oedema.<br>
During this time, there are swollen superficial lymph nodes present.<br>
The next sign of the disease is the development of nodules, which are its most distinctive feature. Flystrike risk may increase if these nodules are necrotic and ulcerate.<br>
Note: Flystrike is a disorder where flies lay their eggs on an animal’s skin, and as the eggs hatch, the resulting maggots eat away at the skin. It is a potentially lethal infection for the animal.<br>
</p>

<h2>HOSTS</h2>
<p>
Cattle and buffalo, particularly water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), are affected by lumpy skin conditions.
</p>
<h2>MODE OF TRANSMISSION<h2>
<P>
It has been found that the lumpy skin disorder can be propagated mechanically via tick and fly bites.<br>
Furthermore, it can be transmitted through contacting saliva, nasal secretions, or semen.


</P>

<h2>PREVENTION<h2>
<P>
The prevention of lumpy skin disease can be done by following these steps.<br>
1.Quarantine of suspected cattle<br>
2.Vaccination of cattle<br>
3.Culling of infected cattle<br>
</P>

<h2>TREATMENT</h2>
<p>
The virus has no known cure, hence the greatest defence against infection is the vaccination of cattle.

</p>

<h2>RECOVERY</h2>
<p>
The recovery process from Lumpy Skin Disease can take the cattle many months, and in most cases, the secondary illnesses that develop make it take longer.<br>

An infected animal’s full recovery in some circumstances could take up to 6 months.
</p>
<h2>WILL IT AFFECT HUMANS?</h2>

<p>
Lumpy Skin Disease is not contagious to humans because it only affects cattle and buffalo.
